# Game of Life ðŸ¦€

Implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and compiled to [WASM](https://www.rust-lang.org/what/wasm). Deployed version [available here](https://aleks.bg/life/).

Roughly follows the Tutorial laid out in the [Rust & Wasm](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/game-of-life/implementing.html) book; especially the Rust part does not follow it closely.
